# Homework 1

## Introduction (Person 2)

A section called "Introduction" where you provide a short summary of the
structure of your homework. Moreover, record a short video to introduce
your group and include it in your RMarkdown document.

## Group Members (Person 1 for general structure)

**Important: Still everyone needs to fill in their own profile**

A section called "Group Members". This section should have one
subsection for each group member in your team. For example, a group with
three members should have three subsections. Each of these subsections
(named after each group member) should include small biographies
containing at least the following elements:

-   An avatar picture. Make sure to include a caption for this image.
    Make sure all pictures have the same size.

-   A paragraph describing your favorite hobby as well as one
    interesting fact about yourself (preferably true).

-   Your favorite quote in blockquote format. Make sure to reference
    your quote using BibTex.

-   A table having two columns (first column containing the classes you
    are following this semester; second column containing the time of
    these classes).

-   Add at least one emoji and one Giphy per group member.

## RMarkdown Syntax

### Chunk using cache (Person 2)

-   Illustrate an example to demonstrate a situation where caching a
    chunk using cache = T leads to incorrect execution of the code.
    Provide a brief explanation of the results observed.

### Poisson distribution (Person 3)

Generate 2000 random samples from a Poisson distribution with
$\lambda = 2$ using the function rpois(). Store these 2000 values in a
vector called y. Then, compute the empirical mean and variance of y. Are
these different from the theoretical values of mean and variance for a
Poisson distribution, which both equal $\lambda$? If they are different,
justify why this might be the case.

### Graph

Create a graph to present the histogram of y. Set the number of bins to
10 and make sure to include a caption for your figure. Now, change the
number of bins to 50. How does the change in the number of bins affect
the visual interpretation of the data?

Include the following equation:

![eq1](hw1_eq1.png)

Include the following in-line equation:

![eq2](hw1_eq2.png){style="display: inline-block; margin: 0"
width="100px"}

### Article and bibliography (Person 4)

Visit the website arxiv and search for the paper called "On Localization
of the Fractional Discrete Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger Equation". Locate
Equation (2.5) and include it here. Cite the paper by adding the
reference in your bibTex file. Your answer should start with "In (insert
reference here), the singular integral representation of the fractional
Laplacian is defined as"

$$
\text{insert equation here.}
$$

Present the following quote in blue: "The only thing that is constant is
change.", Heraclitus. **(Person 4)**

Insert a "Show/Hide Answer" button that reveals the solution to a given
problem when clicked. **(Person 4)**

Insert a "color box" with the following text: "Learning never exhausts
the mind." - Leonardo da Vinci **(Person 2)**
